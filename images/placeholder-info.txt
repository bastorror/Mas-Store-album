# Sample Placeholder Image
# This is just a text file to show the structure
# Replace this with actual PNG files for your snacks

# Example file structure:
# images/
#   ├── chips-1.png
#   ├── chips-2.png
#   ├── sweets-1.png
#   └── ... (other PNG files)

# The website will automatically:
# 1. Try to load the PNG image first
# 2. If the image fails to load, show the emoji fallback
# 3. Apply proper styling to both images and emojis
